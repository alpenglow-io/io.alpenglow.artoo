# Trydent

## Why the name

The first project name was **OAK**; I wanted to make a tribute to the very first Java version. I felt fine about it, but sunddendly I found OAK was a name for another library or framework (I didn't dig too much), so I decided for a change. **Trydent** is the official name and it means different kind of things:
 . it is the Polish name of my home town, Trento
 . its etymology derives from latin word *tridentum*, that is trident
 . it was a company looking for *OOParts*, out-of-place artifacts, in one of my favourite manga comics, Spriggan.

In order to build with tests, `MAVEN_OPTS` set to `--enable-preview` is needed.
